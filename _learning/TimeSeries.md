# What Questions Are Important With Time Series?

Let's take an example. Let's take me going to the grocery store, one of my least favorite chores.

I go to the grocery store...sometimes. Let's say I collect all the data of when I go to the store. What questions can I answer?

Raw Time:
1) When did I go to the store in raw terms? Like on a calendar.
2) What is my intermittent store traveling? Aka how many days pass before I go to the store?

Days of Week:
1) What days of the week did I tend to go to the store?
2) Is there a day of the week I didn't go to the store?
3) Is there a day of the week I usually went to the store?

Month:
1) What month was I going to the store the most? Maybe shows trends.

Day:
1) Did I ever go to the store within the same day?

Micro:
1) How long did I shop at the store?
  - what about trends? Does this change over time? By day of week?
  - What does that tell us?
      - sometimes I go just to pick up...does that show when I'm stressed or busy?

Streaks:
1) What's the longest I've gone without going to the store?
2) What's the shortest I've gone between trips?
3) How many consecutive weeks did I go to the store?
4) How many consecutive days did I got to the store? (Hopefully none, but it is a few)

Other actors:
1) What changes if I include my wife in this analysis?
2) How often do I go when she does? What about separately?
3) Do I spend more or less time when we go together?




Let's change the scenario just to see if I covered them all.

What if I want to look at when my dog sleeps?

Inner Day:
1) What hours of the day did she fall asleep today?
2) How long was she asleep today in total? Percent of day?
3) How does what hour of the day affect when she fell asleep?
4) What's the earliest she's woken up? What's the latest she's gone to bed?
4) When is her latest nap? Earliest nap?
5) How many naps does she take?
6) What is a nap even?

Day of Week:
1) Does she sleep less on the weekends because I'm home?
2) Does she sleep most on Sunday because I like to nap on Sundays?
3) What day of the week does she sleep the most? the least?

Raw:
1) Has she slept more since she was born? Or less?

Streaks:
1) Longest nap? Sleep? Shortest?
2) Day with most sleep? Least?


Other Factors:
1) Does she sleep longer when she's played more?
2) Do naps ruin her actual sleep?
